# Render
This project aims to render the HTML and CSS code typed in the browser itself. It was built using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript(with a tiny bit of JQuery).

#Installation Instructions
* Download the `ZIP` file and extract all files using a suitable application to a target folder.
* Open the `render.html` file using your Web browser.
 
#Information about the latest version
* The entire HTML structure was restructured and restyled using `Flexbox`.
* The website is now fully responsive.
* The latest update to the `myscript.js` file has ensured that we can indent the code in the `HTMLText` and `CSSText` textareas using `tab` just like in a normal text editor.
